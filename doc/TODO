Release 1.1
==================================================

 * For those Maple pins which have top layer tracks, put vias next to
   them for easier making when plated drills are not available.
 * Move vias next to the motors to allow motor brackets on the surface.
 * Move the bluetooth switch to the bottom of the board (away from the
   screw).
 * Make some wholes bellow the Maple for the ball caster.
 ? Switch S0 and S1 for U2 in the sensor array (they were swapped for
   easier connection, but reading the array from the program would be
   more straight forward).

Release 2.0
==================================================

 * Integrate the micro in the PCB.
 * Integrate the motor power converter in the board.
 * Use common 0.1 inches, 3 pin connectors for the external modules. Use
   PIN_ARRAY_1 pins to allow custom connections to the Maple for the
   non-used PIN_ARRAY_3X1 connector pins.
 * Use a MOSFET in the sensor array to turn off emmiters by default.
 * Make use of an extra digital pin for module enable/disable.
